I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in Research Institute of Advanced Materials (RIAM) at Seoul National University (SNU).

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH).

My current research focuses on the `Design of Catalytic Materials`. I have studied atomistic phenomena on catalytic surfaces to develop catalytic materials with improved catalytic capability under the philosophy of rational design. To achieve the goal, I use computational approaches, e.g., `First-Principles Calculations` and `Artificial Intelligence (AI)`. Applications include heterogeneous catalysis for exhaust emission control, hydrogen production, and utilization of emission gas to realize carbon neutralization. Any research inquiry is welcome!
