I am studying as a Ph.D. student with major of chemical engineering in POSTECH.

My current research focuses on the `design of catalytic materials`. Materials with improved catalytic capability is developed under the philosophy of rational design by computational approaches, e.g., `first-principles calculations` and `machine learning`. Applications include heterogeneous catalysis for exhaust emission control and hydrogen production. Any research inquiry is welcome.
