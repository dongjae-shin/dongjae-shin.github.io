I am currently working as a postdoctoral scholar in SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Stanford University.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH).

My current research focuses on the `Design of Catalytic Materials`. I have studied atomistic phenomena on catalytic surfaces to develop materials with improved catalytic capability under the philosophy of rational design. To achieve this goal, I use computational approaches, e.g., `First-Principles Calculations` and `Artificial Intelligence (AI)`. Applications include heterogeneous catalysis for exhaust emission control, hydrogen production, and utilization of emission gas to realize carbon neutralization.
