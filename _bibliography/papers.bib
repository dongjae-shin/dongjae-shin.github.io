  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract = {Catalyst design with good stability beyond simply having high activity is crucial for a variety of reactions. Here, we evaluate the ceria catalyst for CO oxidation as a model reaction to rationally design an ultrastable catalyst with high activity. The goal was achieved by co-doping with rare-earth (RE) and transition metals (TM) simultaneously. The RE dopant stabilized the catalyst by inhibiting sintering that could lead to catalyst deactivation. The TM dopant increased the activity by facilitating formation of surface defects. Consequently, ceria co-doped with RE (=La, Sm) and TM (=Cu) had increased catalytic activity as well as superior resistance to deactivation during 10 cycle measurement (1 cycle: 900 °C, 24 h → cooling at room temperature → target °C, 24 h) of ∼700 h, which is harsher than any other reported conditions. This approach will shed light on the design of ultrastable oxide materials for a wide range of catalytic reactions.},

  abstract = {The water–gas shift reaction (WGSR) is important in industries because it can reduce the CO content of syngas to produce purified H2, which can be used as fuel or to make ammonia (NH3). Supported noble metal catalysts have been widely studied for the WGSR because they exhibit high reactivity. However, the role of a metal–support interface in the WGSR has not yet been revealed and remains elusive. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed for a model system of Co3O4-supported Pd (Pd/Co3O4) catalysts. The presence of the interface was found to promote the H2O dissociation step, which is crucial for improving WGSR activity. Thus, the WGSR activity was predicted to be enhanced by an increased number of interfaces, which could be achieved by controlling the size of the supported Pd nanoparticles (NPs). Furthermore, electronic metal–support interactions (MSIs) were found to be a source of the promoted H2O dissociation at the interface. The DFT-predicted promotion of H2O dissociation was further experimentally validated using Pd/Co3O4 catalysts that were size-controlled with calcination temperatures, and the total length of the interface was shown to have a direct correlation with the WGSR rate. Theoretical insights into the role of the interface and the enhancement of WGSR activity due to increased interface sites, which can be achieved by size control, are believed to be useful in the design of efficient supported metal catalysts for the WGSR.},

  abstract = {For oxide-supported metal catalysts, support reducibility and metal dispersion are the key factors to determine the activity and selectivity in many essential reactions involving redox process. Herein, we tuned the exposed surface atoms of the catalyst by facet control and doping methods, which were simultaneously applied to boost the reducibility and metal dispersion of an oxide support. Pd supported on Cu-doped CeO2 (Pd/CDC) for water–gas shift reaction (WGSR) was considered a model system; Cu was doped into the cubic and octahedral CeO2 enclosed with (100) and (111) facets, respectively. By a systematic combination of density functional theory calculations and experimental analyses, the WGSR activity of the Pd/CDC cube was verified to synergistically increase by more than just the sum of the morphology and Cu doping effects. The effect of each tuning method on the activity was further investigated from a mechanistic perspective. This work presents a rational design knowledge to enhance the catalytic activity that can be extended to a wide range of supported metal systems.},

  abstract = {Elemental mercury (Hg0), mostly from coal combustion, poses a critical threat to ecosystems and the health of human beings, as it causes several fatal human diseases. Thus, there has been an effort to strengthen regulations around the world. Catalytic oxidation of Hg0 into HgCl2 is considered an economical and practical option, and selective catalytic reduction catalysts such as titania-supported vanadia (VOx/TiO2) have been shown to also oxidize Hg0 to Hg2+. Herein, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate the relationship between the coordinative environment of V in the VOx/TiO2 catalyst and the catalytic activity towards Hg0 oxidation, as well as the effect of hydroxylation. We mechanistically estimate the Hg0 oxidation activity of several VOx/TiO2 models using previously reported mechanisms. We also explore the temperature (T)- and pressure (p)-dependent thermodynamic stabilities of the VOx/TiO2 catalyst models by calculating the Gibbs free energy of formation (Î”Gform). Finally, the thermodynamic (T, p) conditions that favor high activity of the VOx/TiO2 catalyst are suggested.}
